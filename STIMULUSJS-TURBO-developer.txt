<vertical_slice_architecture>
    <definition>
        An architectural approach that organizes code by feature or business capability rather than technical concerns. Each "slice" contains all code necessary to implement a feature **from UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript including Stimulus/Turbo) to data access,** promoting high cohesion within features and loose coupling between features.
    </definition>

    <benefits>
        <benefit>Improved developer productivity through co-location of related code (Backend & Frontend)</benefit>
        <benefit>Better maintainability as changes typically affect a single slice</benefit>
        <benefit>Easier onboarding as developers can understand complete features</benefit>
        <benefit>Increased testability through well-defined feature boundaries</benefit>
        <benefit>Reduced cross-cutting dependencies between features</benefit>
        <benefit>Enables independent feature evolution and deployment</benefit>
    </benefits>

    <structure>
        <principle>Organize code primarily by feature/domain concept rather than technical layer</principle>
        <principle>Each feature slice contains its own **UI (Bootstrap-based HTML, specific CSS customizations, Stimulus controllers, Turbo integrations),** business logic, and data access code</principle>
        <principle>UI components within a slice should adhere to the project's **`<StrictTypographyHierarchy>`, `<IconUsageGuidelines>`, and standard interaction patterns (drawers/modals).**</principle>
        <principle>Cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth, etc.) should be handled via composition or aspect-oriented techniques (e.g., middleware, pipeline behaviors)</principle>
        <principle>Use mediator pattern (e.g., CQRS with MediatR) to organize backend operations within slices</principle>
        <principle>Employ **Stimulus.js** for organizing frontend JavaScript interactions within the slice's UI components.</principle>
        <principle>Leverage **Hotwired Turbo** for efficient page navigation and partial updates within and between slices.</principle>

        <StrictTypographyHierarchy Importance="High - Applies to all content and layouts">
            <Philosophy>Implement a clear, consistent visual hierarchy across all text elements using font size, weight, color, and spacing to guide the user's eye and facilitate rapid information parsing. This hierarchy is **non-negotiable** and must be applied universally.</Philosophy>
            <Rules>
                <Rule> Use a distinct hierarchy with strong contrast between levels:
                    • Large Display/Page Title (e.g., H1) – Extra-bold weight, largest font size, significant bottom margin.
                    • Section/Panel Headings (e.g., H2/H3) – Bold weight, noticeably smaller than H1, clear bottom margin.
                    • List Titles / Subheadings / Key Labels (e.g., H4/strong) – Medium-bold or Bold weight, mid-size font, adequate spacing.
                    • Primary Body Text / Descriptions – Regular weight, standard font size, sufficient line-height (e.g., 1.4-1.6).
                    • Secondary/Contextual Text (e.g., helper text, descriptions within lists) – Regular or lighter weight, slightly smaller font size, often a muted grey color (must pass WCAG AA contrast).
                    • Meta Info / Timestamps (e.g., "Edited on May 24") – Smallest font size, light weight, muted grey color, often right-aligned.
                </Rule>
                <Rule> **Heavily utilize bold weights** for primary information elements (headings, item names, critical data points, button text) to make them pop. Contrast this with regular or lighter weights for descriptive or less critical text.</Rule>
                <Rule> Employ **muted grey colors** (#6c757d or similar, check contrast) and potentially slightly smaller font sizes for secondary text elements (e.g., short descriptions under list titles, placeholder text, helper messages) to visually de-emphasize them relative to primary content.</Rule>
                <Rule> Ensure sufficient **vertical whitespace** (margins/padding) around all typographic elements, especially bold headings and between list items, to prevent visual clutter and enhance readability. Spacing should be consistent based on the hierarchy level.</Rule>
                <Rule> List Item Styling:
                    • Main Item/Title: Normal contrast (black/dark grey), regular to semi-bold weight.
                    • Secondary Description (if present): Muted grey color, smaller font size, placed below the title.
                    • Associated Meta/Date (if present): Muted grey color, smallest font size, typically right-aligned on the same line or below the description.
                </Rule>
                <Rule> Maintain slightly larger **line-heights** (e.g., 1.4-1.6 for body, adjusted appropriately for headings) than browser defaults for improved readability across blocks of text.</Rule>
                <Rule> Implement **responsive typography** (using Bootstrap utilities like `.fs-*`, responsive `.h*` classes, or custom media queries) so the established visual hierarchy scales appropriately and remains clear across all viewport sizes.</Rule>
                <Rule> Adhere strictly to **WCAG AA contrast ratios** *at minimum*, especially critical for the muted grey text used for secondary information.</Rule>

        <IconUsageGuidelines Importance="High - Applies to all relevant interactive elements">
            <Philosophy>Icons significantly aid visual scanning, action recognition, and overall UI clarity. Their use on specific interactive elements is **mandatory** and follows consistent styling rules.</Philosophy>
            <Rules>
                <Rule> **All Buttons Must Have Icons:** Every `<button>` or button-like `<a>` tag **must** include an associated icon positioned before the text label. This provides immediate visual context for the button's action.</Rule>
                <Rule> Button Icon Styles:
                    • **Outlined Icons:** Use for buttons in less prominent areas like sidebars, navigation bars, or secondary actions (e.g., language switcher, settings icon in header). Outlined style implies lower visual weight.
                    • **Filled Icons:** Use for buttons within the main content area, primary call-to-actions, confirmation buttons in modals, or actions directly related to content manipulation (e.g., Add, Edit, Delete, Save). Filled style implies higher visual weight and importance.
                </Rule>
                <Rule> Button Text Weight: Button text label should typically be semi-bold or bold to complement the icon and stand out as an interactive element.</Rule>
                <Rule> **All Form Input Fields Must Have Icons:** Every `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or visually similar form control (excluding `<select>` initially, but consider for custom selects) **must** incorporate an associated icon, usually placed inside the field near the start edge.</Rule>
                <Rule> Input Field Icon & Label Behavior:
                    • **Icon Present:** If an input has an icon, the label text **must** be implemented using the `placeholder` attribute. The visual label is the placeholder text inside the field.
                    • **Icon Absent (Fallback - Avoid if possible):** In the rare case an appropriate icon cannot be found or used, the input **must** use a floating label pattern (where the label moves from inside the input to above it on focus/input). This is a fallback, prioritize finding an icon.
                    • Input Label Text Style: The placeholder text (acting as the label) should be styled distinctly from user-typed text – typically semi-bold or regular weight and potentially a slightly muted color, while user input is standard weight and color.
                </Rule>
                <Rule> **Dropdown Menu Items Must Have Icons:** Each actionable item within a dropdown menu (Bootstrap `.dropdown-item` or similar) **must** also include an icon before its text label to maintain consistency and scannability, generally following the 'filled' style contextually.</Rule>
                <Rule> Icon Consistency: Use icons from a single, consistent library (e.g., Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome, Material Symbols) to maintain visual harmony.</Rule>
