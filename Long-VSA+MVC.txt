    **CRITICAL WARNING:** This project operates under extreme scrutiny with significant legal and financial consequences for failure. **Every mistake (validation, core logic, error handling, event processing, external service interaction) is potentially punishable by law and could lead to catastrophic outcomes.** ZERO tolerance for negligence. Absolute precision, rigorous validation/testing, comprehensive error handling, reliable event processing, robust external service interaction, and inherent security are **mandatory legal and operational requirements.** Failure is unacceptable.

<vertical_slice_architecture>
    <definition>
        An architectural approach that organizes code by feature or business capability rather than technical concerns. Each "slice" contains all code necessary to implement a feature from entry point (Controller/Command) to data access, promoting high cohesion within features and loose coupling between features.
    </definition>

    <benefits>
        <benefit>Improved developer productivity through co-location of related code within a feature slice.</benefit>
        <benefit>Better maintainability as changes typically affect a single slice.</benefit>
        <benefit>Easier onboarding as developers can understand complete features by examining their slice.</benefit>
        <benefit>Increased testability through well-defined feature boundaries.</benefit>
        <benefit>Reduced cross-cutting dependencies between features.</benefit>
        <benefit>Enables independent feature evolution and deployment.</benefit>
    </benefits>

    <structure>
        <principle>
            **Mandatory Structure:** Code is organized **strictly** by Feature Slice into top-level directories (e.g., `src/Order/`, `src/Project/`, `src/Task/`).
        </principle>
        <principle>
            **Strict Colocation:** ALL code related to a specific feature **MUST** reside within its corresponding Feature Slice directory. No exceptions.
        </principle>
        <principle>
            **Slice Internal Structure:** Within each Feature Slice directory, the following specific sub-directories **MUST** be created as needed:
            - `Controllers/` (for HTTP entry points initiating a Use Case)
            - `Commands/` (for CLI entry points initiating a Use Case)
            - `Models/` (for Entities, Value Objects specific to the feature)
            - `Repositories/` (for concrete data access classes interfacing with the feature's models)
            - `UseCases/` (for specific action/workflow logic)
            - `Services/` (Strictly for wrappers/clients interacting with *external* services/systems)
            - `Events/` (for defining events dispatched by the feature)
            - `Listeners/` (for handling events relevant to the feature)
            - `Exceptions/` (for custom exceptions specific to the feature)
            - `Helpers/` (for feature-specific utility functions/classes - use sparingly)
            - `DTOs/` (Optional: for shared read models or complex data structures not tied to a single Use Case request/response)
        </principle>
        <principle>
            **UseCases Sub-Structure:** The `UseCases/` directory **MUST** contain further sub-directories, each named after a specific use case (e.g., `UseCases/ProcessOrder/`, `UseCases/CreateTask/`).
        </principle>
        <principle>
            **UseCase Directory Contents:** Each specific use case directory (e.g., `UseCases/ProcessOrder/`) **MUST** contain at minimum:
            - The core logic **Handler** class (e.g., `ProcessOrderHandler.php`).
            - The **Input** Command or Query object (e.g., `ProcessOrderCommand.php`).
            - An optional **Response** object if the use case returns structured data (e.g., `ProcessOrderResponse.php`).
        </principle>
        <principle>
            **Relationship Indication:** Relationships between features (e.g., Task belongs to Project) are handled via IDs within `Models/` (e.g., Task model has `$projectId`). The file structure reflects this by having separate slices (`Project/`, `Task/`). Query Use Cases in one slice might utilize the `Repository` from another slice *only for retrieving data necessary to fulfill its purpose*. Command Use Cases should primarily operate within their own slice's domain.
        </principle>
        <principle>Cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation pipelines, transaction management) should be handled via composition, middleware, decorators, or pipeline behaviors applied *outside* the core Use Case handler logic where possible.</principle>

<rules>
    <code_organization>
        <rule>Design for **absolute correctness and maintainability first**, performance second, elegance third.</rule>

        <rule>Create abstractions only when they provide clear value, reduce complexity, and facilitate testing or cross-cutting concerns, not just for the sake of abstraction.</rule>

    </code_organization>

    <vertical_slice_implementation>
        <rule>Each feature slice **MUST** contain all code related to that feature within the mandated directory structure (`Controllers/`, `Commands/`, `Models/`, `Repositories/`, `UseCases/`, `Services/`, `Events/`, `Listeners/`, `Exceptions/`, `Helpers/`, `DTOs/`).</rule>
        <rule>Each feature slice **MUST** contain its own `README.md` file with up-to-date documentation about the feature, its use cases, and any critical operational details.</rule>
        <rule>Minimize cross-feature dependencies. Communication between features should primarily occur via:
            a) Dispatching/listening to `Events/`.
            b) Query Use Cases reading data via another feature's `Repositories/` using IDs.
            c) Invoking another feature's Use Case via a lightweight application service or mediator if direct coupling is unavoidable and justified. Direct dependency on another feature's `Handler` is discouraged.
        </rule>
        <rule>Implement the mediator pattern (Command/Query handlers within `UseCases/`) for every action/query within each slice.</rule>
        <rule>Entry Point Naming Convention: `Controllers/` and `Commands/` class files **MUST** be named directly after the primary Use Case they initiate (e.g., `ProcessOrderController.php` invokes `UseCases/ProcessOrder/ProcessOrderHandler.php`, `CreateTaskCommand.php` invokes `UseCases/CreateTask/CreateTaskHandler.php`).</rule>
        <rule>Concrete Repositories: Primarily use concrete Repository classes within `Repositories/`. Avoid defining separate interfaces for these *internal* repositories unless abstraction is strictly needed for testing complex scenarios or cross-cutting concerns applied via decorators.</rule>
        <rule>Extract truly common, *feature-agnostic* code (e.g., base classes, core interfaces, shared value objects, cross-cutting concern implementations) to a dedicated shared/core module ONLY when it is demonstrably used by multiple features and cannot logically reside within a single feature slice.</rule>
        <rule>Apply cross-cutting concerns like validation, transaction management, logging, and security checks primarily through pipeline behaviors, middleware, or decorators acting on the Command/Query objects or around the `Handler` execution, keeping the Handler focused on core logic.</rule>
        <rule>Keep domain models (`Models/`) strictly internal to their feature slice unless explicitly designed as shared kernel models residing in a core module.</rule>
        <rule>Register feature dependencies (repositories, services, etc.) in feature-specific configuration or dependency injection modules.</rule>
    </vertical_slice_implementation>

    <framework_agnostic_practices>
        <rule>NEVER allow unhandled exceptions to propagate to user interface layers (Controllers, Commands). Implement robust global and local error handling.</rule>
        <rule>Use dependency injection **rigorously** for managing dependencies within and between components.</rule>
        <rule>Implement comprehensive, **strict** input validation at system boundaries (Controllers, Commands, public methods of Services).</rule>
        <rule>Leverage ORM capabilities and query builders correctly to prevent SQL injection and other data access vulnerabilities. **All data access MUST be secure by default.**</rule>
        <rule>Implement middleware/interceptors/pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, authorization, and transaction management.</rule>
        <rule>Follow convention over configuration where appropriate, but **explicit configuration is preferred for clarity in critical systems**.</rule>

        <rule>Preserve existing functionality rigorously when refactoring or enhancing code. Add regression tests.</rule>
        <rule>Create abstractions **only** when they provide clear architectural benefits like testability or decoupling, adhering to the established patterns.</rule>
