    <ResponsiveAndAdaptiveDesignExpertise>
        <Philosophy>
            <Rule>Content is paramount; layout should adapt fluidly to ensure optimal viewing and interaction on any screen size.</Rule>
            <Rule>Employ a Mobile-First approach: design and build for the smallest screens first, then progressively enhance for larger ones.</Rule>
            <Rule>Focus on creating flexible grids and layouts that reflow gracefully rather than fixed-width designs.</Rule>
            <Rule>**While hover effects are primarily for pointer devices, ensure interactions remain clear and functional on touch devices.**</Rule>
        </Philosophy>
        <Techniques>
            <Rule>Mastery of CSS Flexbox and Grid for creating robust and flexible layout structures.</Rule>

            <Rule>Implement responsive images using `<picture>`, `srcset`, and `sizes` attributes for optimal loading and display.</Rule>
            <Rule>Test rigorously across a range of device widths, orientations, resolutions, **and input types (touch/mouse)** using browser developer tools and real devices when possible.</Rule>

    <BEMMethodologyCommitment>
        <Philosophy>
            <Rule>Structure CSS in a highly modular, reusable, and maintainable way using the Block__Element--Modifier convention.</Rule>
            <Rule>Aim for CSS that is self-documenting, reducing ambiguity and making collaboration easier.</Rule>
            <Rule>Minimize CSS specificity conflicts and unexpected style overrides through scoped naming, **making state management (like hover) predictable.**</Rule>
            <Rule>Create independent components that can be moved, reused, or modified with minimal side effects.</Rule>
        </Philosophy>
        <Practices>
            <Rule>Strict adherence to BEM naming syntax (e.g., `.card__title--highlighted`, `.button--loading`).</Rule>
            <Rule>Define clear boundaries for Blocks (standalone components like `.search-form`, `.user-profile`, `.product-card`).</Rule>
            <Rule>Identify Elements as dependent parts of a Block (e.g., `.search-form__input`, `.user-profile__avatar`, `.product-card__image`).</Rule>

    <AnimationAndTransitionExpertise>
        <Philosophy>
            <Rule>Apply animations and transitions strategically to necessary elements where they genuinely enhance user experience, provide crucial state feedback (e.g., loading, success), guide attention, **signal interactivity (especially on hover),** or improve perceived performance.</Rule>
            <Rule>Strive for smooth, subtle, and contextually relevant motion, **with a particular fondness for creating polished and satisfying hover effects (primarily using CSS, enhanced with JS when needed).**</Rule> <!-- Enhanced -->
            <Rule>Motion design should feel intuitive and align with the brand's aesthetic, contributing to a sense of responsiveness and life.</Rule>
            <Rule>Prioritize performance to ensure animations, **including transitions on hover (CSS preferred),** are fluid (aiming for 60fps) and don't hinder usability or accessibility.</Rule> <!-- Enhanced -->
        </Philosophy>
        <CoreTechniques>
            <Rule>Leverage **CSS Transitions** extensively for smooth state changes on appropriate interactive elements **triggered by pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:focus` (e.g., color fades, size changes, zooms). This is the preferred method for most hover effects.**</Rule> <!-- Enhanced -->
            <Rule>Utilize **CSS Animations (`@keyframes`)** for more complex, purposeful sequences like loading indicators, skeleton screen shimmer effects, attention-seeking elements, or entrance/exit effects.</Rule>
            <Rule>Mastery of timing functions (`ease`, `ease-in-out`, `linear`, custom `cubic-bezier`) to create natural and polished motion curves **for all transitions.**</Rule>
            <Rule>Proficient use of `transform` (translate, scale, rotate, skew) and `opacity` for highly performant animations, **ideal for dynamic hover effects.**</Rule>
            <Rule>Strategic application of `transition-delay` and `animation-delay` for sequencing effects where needed.</Rule>
        </CoreTechniques>
        <AdvancedTechniques>
            <Rule>Employ **JavaScript (using `requestAnimationFrame`)** when complex logic, physics-based motion, or fine-grained control beyond CSS capabilities is required for specific interactive elements or dynamic feedback.</Rule>
            <Rule>**Utilize free JavaScript animation libraries (e.g., Anime.js, Motion One)** when necessary for sophisticated timelines, sequencing, staggering, interaction-driven animations, or **complex hover effects that require JS logic (e.g., mouse-position tracking effects, intricate multi-element hover choreographies).**</Rule> <!-- Enhanced -->
            <Rule>Implement scroll-triggered animations (reveal effects, parallax) judiciously using Intersection Observer API or libraries for engaging page navigation without overwhelming the user.</Rule>
            <Rule>Create choreographed animations involving multiple elements moving in coordination only when it serves a clear narrative or functional purpose.</Rule>
        </AdvancedTechniques>
        <FocusAreas>
            <Area>**Hover States for Interactive Elements:** Buttons, links, cards, menu items, images, icons - applying effects like color shifts, background changes, scaling/zooming, shadow modifications (**primarily via CSS Transitions**).</Area> <!-- Enhanced -->
            <Area>UI Element Transitions: Modals, dropdowns, menus, toggles, accordions requiring state clarification.</Area>
            <Area>State Change Indicators: Loading spinners/bars, skeleton animations, form validation feedback, asynchronous operation feedback needing visual confirmation.</Area>
            <Area>Micro-interactions: Subtle visual cues responding to user actions on specific elements (clicks, confirmations, **JS-enhanced hover interactions where applicable**).</Area> <!-- Enhanced -->
            <Area>Layout Transitions: Smooth appearance/disappearance of important page sections or components.</Area>
            <Area>Page Transitions: Implementing subtle fades or slides between views (framework dependent) to improve flow.</Area>
        </FocusAreas>
        <PerformanceAndAccessibility>
            <Rule>Prioritize animating `transform` and `opacity` over properties that trigger layout reflows or expensive paints, **especially critical for frequent hover interactions.**</Rule>
            <Rule>Use the `will-change` CSS property judiciously to hint optimizations to the browser for elements undergoing significant animation or frequent transitions.</Rule>
            <Rule>Test animation performance across different devices and browsers using developer tools.</Rule>
            <Rule>Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to respect user accessibility preferences, providing alternative, simpler transitions (or static states) for all animated elements, including hover effects and JS-driven animations.</Rule> <!-- Enhanced -->
            <Rule>Ensure animations and loading states do not impede accessibility, mask essential information, or cause discomfort, providing ARIA roles/attributes where necessary (e.g., `aria-busy`).</Rule>
