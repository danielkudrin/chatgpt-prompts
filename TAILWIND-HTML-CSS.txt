     <StrictTypographyHierarchy Importance="High - Applies to all content and layouts">
        <Philosophy>Implement a clear, consistent visual hierarchy across all text elements using **Tailwind utility classes** for font size (`text-*`), weight (`font-*`), color (`text-*`), line-height (`leading-*`), letter-spacing (`tracking-*`), and vertical spacing (`m*`, `p*`) to guide the user's eye and facilitate rapid information parsing. Configuration is primarily managed in `tailwind.config.js`. This hierarchy is **non-negotiable** and must be applied universally.</Philosophy>
        <Rules>
            <Rule> Use a distinct hierarchy with strong contrast between levels, applied via Tailwind utilities:
                • Large Display/Page Title (e.g., `.page-title` BEM class) – Apply boldest weight (`font-black`, `font-extrabold`), largest font size (`text-4xl`, `text-5xl`), significant bottom margin (`mb-6`, `mb-8`).
                • Section/Panel Headings (e.g., `.section__heading`) – Apply bold weight (`font-bold`), noticeably smaller size (`text-2xl`, `text-3xl`), clear bottom margin (`mb-4`).
                • List Titles / Subheadings / Key Labels (e.g., `.list__title`, `.form-label`) – Apply medium/semi-bold weight (`font-medium`, `font-semibold`), mid-size font (`text-lg`, `text-xl`), adequate spacing (`mb-2`).
                • Primary Body Text / Descriptions (e.g., `.card__description`) – Apply regular weight (`font-normal`), standard font size (`text-base`), sufficient line-height (`leading-relaxed`).
                • Secondary/Contextual Text (e.g., `.form-hint`, `.list-item__meta`) – Apply regular/light weight, slightly smaller size (`text-sm`), often a muted grey color (`text-slate-500`, `text-gray-600` - must pass WCAG AA contrast).
                • Meta Info / Timestamps (e.g., `.post__timestamp`) – Smallest font size (`text-xs`), light weight, muted grey color, often right-aligned (`ml-auto` or `text-right`).
            </Rule>
            <Rule> **Heavily utilize bold weights** (e.g., `font-semibold`, `font-bold`) for primary information elements via Tailwind utilities. Contrast this with regular weights (`font-normal`, `font-light`) for descriptive text.</Rule>
            <Rule> Employ **muted grey colors** (defined in `tailwind.config.js`, applied like `text-gray-500`) and potentially smaller font sizes (`text-sm`, `text-xs`) for secondary text elements.</Rule>
            <Rule> Ensure sufficient **vertical whitespace** using Tailwind's spacing scale (`mb-*`, `py-*`) around all typographic elements, especially bold headings and between list items.</Rule>
            <Rule> List Item Styling (Example BEM: `.list-item` block):
                • Main Item/Title (`.list-item__title`): Normal contrast color, normal to semi-bold weight (`font-medium`).
                • Secondary Description (`.list-item__description`): Muted grey color (`text-gray-500`), smaller font size (`text-sm`), below title (`mt-1`).
                • Associated Meta/Date (`.list-item__meta`): Muted grey color, smallest font size (`text-xs`), typically right-aligned (`ml-auto`).
            </Rule>
            <Rule> Maintain consistent **line-heights** using Tailwind utilities (e.g., `leading-normal`, `leading-relaxed`) for improved readability.</Rule>
            <Rule> Implement **responsive typography** using Tailwind's variants (e.g., `text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl`) so the hierarchy scales appropriately.</Rule>
            <Rule> Adhere strictly to **WCAG AA contrast ratios** *at minimum*, checking configured muted colors against backgrounds.</Rule>
            <Rule> Consider using the **`@tailwindcss/typography` plugin** for styling prose/markdown content consistently according to the defined hierarchy.</Rule>
        </Rules>
    </StrictTypographyHierarchy>

    <IconUsageGuidelines Importance="High - Applies to all relevant interactive elements">
        <Philosophy>Icons significantly aid visual scanning, action recognition, and overall UI clarity. Their use on specific interactive elements is **mandatory** and follows consistent styling rules, applied via **Tailwind utilities** to embedded SVGs or icon components.</Philosophy>
        <Rules>
            <Rule> **All Buttons Must Have Icons:** Every `<button>` or button-like `<a>` (with BEM class e.g., `.button`) **must** include an associated icon (SVG or component) positioned before the text label. Style icon size and spacing using Tailwind (`w-5 h-5 mr-2`).</Rule>
            <Rule> Button Icon Styles (Visual distinction achieved via SVG `stroke`/`fill` attributes styled with Tailwind's color utilities):
                • **Outlined Icons:** Use SVGs with `stroke="currentColor"` and `fill="none"`. Use for buttons in less prominent areas (sidebar, nav). Apply appropriate `stroke-width`. Lower visual weight.
                • **Filled Icons:** Use SVGs with `fill="currentColor"` (and potentially `stroke="currentColor"` if outlines needed). Use for primary CTAs, content actions (Add, Edit, Delete), modal confirmations. Higher visual weight.
            </Rule>
            <Rule> Button Text Weight: Button text label (`.button__label`) should typically have semi-bold/medium weight (`font-semibold`, `font-medium`) applied via Tailwind.</Rule>
            <Rule> **All Form Input Fields Must Have Icons:** Every `<input>`, `<textarea>` (BEM e.g., `.input-field` block) **must** incorporate an associated icon (SVG/component), usually positioned absolutely inside the field near the start edge using Tailwind positioning utilities.</Rule>
            <Rule> Input Field Icon & Label Behavior:
                • **Icon Present:** If an input has an icon, the label text **must** be implemented using the `placeholder` attribute. Style placeholder via Tailwind (`placeholder:text-gray-500`).
                • **Icon Absent (Fallback - Avoid if possible):** If an icon cannot be used, the input **must** use a floating label pattern (e.g., using JS to toggle classes or a library).
                • Input Label Text Style: The placeholder text should be styled distinctly (e.g., `placeholder:font-medium placeholder:text-sm`) from user-typed text (which uses default input styles).
            </Rule>
            <Rule> **Dropdown Menu Items Must Have Icons:** Each actionable item within a dropdown menu (BEM e.g., `.dropdown__item`) **must** include an icon (SVG/component) before its text label, styled with Tailwind (`w-4 h-4 mr-2`), generally following the 'filled' style contextually.</Rule>
            <Rule> Icon Consistency: Use icons from a single library (e.g., Heroicons, Lucide) and embed consistently (as SVGs directly or via JS components). Use `currentColor` extensively for easy color application with Tailwind utilities (`text-blue-500`).</Rule>
        </Rules>

        </ColorAndTypography>

         <UIInteractionAndFormPatterns>
            <Rule> When creating or updating a CRUD entity, use a right-side drawer instead of a modal—this pattern provides more screen real estate and context for form inputs. Style drawer using Tailwind.</Rule>
            <Rule> For critical user permissions or confirmations, use a modal. The modal should be succinct, with **text following `<StrictTypographyHierarchy>`**. Confirm/Cancel buttons **must include icons** per `<IconUsageGuidelines>`. Style modal using Tailwind utilities.</Rule>
            <Rule> If displaying multiple related actions compactly, group them into a dropdown. **Each dropdown item requires an icon** per `<IconUsageGuidelines>`. Style dropdown using Tailwind utilities.</Rule>
            <Rule> Favor more direct or visual input methods (button groups, datepickers, toggles) over generic `<select>`. Use standard `<select>` as a last resort, potentially styled using `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin.</Rule>
            <Rule> Implement consistent form styling and validation feedback using Tailwind utilities, possibly augmented by the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin or custom utility application.</Rule>

    <DevelopmentApproach>
        <Rule>Translate designs faithfully into **clean, semantic HTML (using BEM for class naming) and efficiently style elements using Tailwind CSS utilities.**</Rule>
        <Rule>Structure HTML using BEM for clarity, relying on **Tailwind's configuration and utility application for all visual styling, consistency, and cohesion, enforcing `<StrictTypographyHierarchy>` and `<IconUsageGuidelines>`.**</Rule>
        <Rule>Implement mobile-first responsive layouts **using Tailwind's variants and layout utilities** adapting beautifully and managing density.</Rule>
        <Rule>Craft smooth, performant, meaningful animations/transitions **primarily using Tailwind's utilities, applying consistently, with meticulous attention to polished hover effects.**</Rule>
        <Rule>Integrate **consistently styled** feedback mechanisms (**styled via Tailwind utilities**), applying the **correct pattern (drawer/modal)** and ensuring **all required icons are present per `<IconUsageGuidelines>`.**</Rule>
        <Rule>Ensure visual fidelity, **interaction speed,** consistency (**including `<IconUsageGuidelines>` patterns**), and accessibility.</Rule>
        <Rule>Write clear, maintainable HTML structure (BEM) and apply Tailwind classes logically and efficiently.</Rule>
        <Rule>Optimize assets and leverage Tailwind's JIT/AOT capabilities for performance and a **snappy, responsive user experience.**</Rule>
        <Rule>Iterate based on feedback, refining details, **visual polish (achieved with Tailwind)**, cohesion, usability, **interaction delight, speed, `<StrictTypographyHierarchy>` compliance, `<IconUsageGuidelines>` adherence,** and responsiveness.</Rule>
    </DevelopmentApproach>
