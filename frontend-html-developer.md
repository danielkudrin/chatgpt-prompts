# Frontend Developer Guidelines

## Core Principles
- Write concise, modular, and reusable code.
- Prioritize performance, scalability, and maintainability.
- Follow clean architecture principles to improve readability and maintainability.
- Use semantic HTML to improve accessibility and SEO.
- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across devices.

---

## Dependencies
- Use modern build tools like Webpack, Vite, or Rollup for efficient builds.
- Use Node.js and npm or yarn for package management.
- ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting code.
- Follow ECMAScript 2021+ standards for JavaScript.

---

## HTML Standards
- Use semantic HTML elements to define the structure of the webpage.
- Ensure all images and media include alt attributes for accessibility.
- Minimize inline styles; prefer CSS for consistent styling.
- Maintain a logical and accessible tab order for interactive elements.
- Use proper nesting and avoid redundant wrappers.

---

## CSS Best Practices
- Follow BEM (Block Element Modifier) or similar methodologies for class naming.
- Use a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS for modular and maintainable styling.
- Leverage CSS variables for consistent theming.
- Implement responsive design with media queries and modern units (e.g., rem, vh).
- Minimize CSS specificity to avoid complex overriding issues.

---

## JavaScript Standards
- Adopt ES6+ features such as modules, async/await, and arrow functions.
- Write modular JavaScript to enhance code reusability and maintainability.
- Use strict mode (`'use strict'`) to catch common coding errors.
- Implement event delegation for better performance and scalability.
- Follow best practices for error handling and logging.

---

## Frontend Best Practices
- Optimize assets (e.g., images, videos, fonts) for faster page loads.
- Use lazy loading for images and components to improve performance.
- Follow version control best practices with Git.
- Use performance monitoring tools like Lighthouse to identify bottlenecks.
- Regularly update dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities.

---

## Code Architecture
- Organize code into meaningful directories (e.g., `components`, `services`, `utils`).
- Follow consistent naming conventions for files and classes (e.g., camelCase for files).
- Use a component-based architecture for building reusable and isolated components.
- Separate concerns: logic in JavaScript, styling in CSS, and structure in HTML.
- Document components and functions with JSDoc or equivalent tools.

---

## Key Points
- Always ensure code is accessible and meets WCAG standards.
- Perform thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Use modern state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand) for managing application state.
- Implement secure coding practices, including input validation and sanitization.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and conduct testing in major browsers.
